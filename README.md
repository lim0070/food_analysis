## Overview

Welcome to Project 3! ðŸ‘‹

This project contains no new material. Rather, it's a good opportunity to sharpen your understanding of the core concepts of the first half of the course. It'll also give you practice with creating visualizations and websites, and will give you something concrete to put on your resume and show to potential employers!

The project is broken into two parts:
- Part 1: An **analysis**, submitted as a Jupyter Notebook. This will contain the details of your work. **Focus on completing your analysis before moving to Part 2, as the analysis is the bulk of the project.**
- Part 2: A **report**, submitted as a website. This will contain a narrative "story" with visuals. **Focus on this after finishing _most_ of your analysis.**

{: .warning }
**The project is due on Thursday, May 18th at 11:59PM**. While there is no checkpoint, we encourage you to finish Part 1 by Monday, May 15th, to leave yourself three days to review your analysis and prepare your report.<br><br>Like other projects, you're welcome to work with a partner, though if you do, you must **both** work on all pieces together, simultaneously. You will only submit one notebook and create one website.
